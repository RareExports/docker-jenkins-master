This will get you up and running with some basic jobs and default config.

1. Make sure you have all the pre-reqs installed (Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows)
2. Clone this repository to your local drive
3.  From the project root run the following
 a. `make build`
 b. `make run` (if this is your first time it will ask for your docker host IP)
